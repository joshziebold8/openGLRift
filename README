    mapwithgrid.png is what I used as a reference
    I didn't have time to fully implement the monsters or textures because I didn't do texcoords while I made the objects.

    I think the map is laid out well based on the reference.  I spent a lot of time making and laying out the objects as accurately as I could.  I also think it looks pretty good with just plain colors even though I don't have textures.  The lighting also works well with all the objects.

    I spent around 42 hours on this project, but I wasn't really keeping track.
